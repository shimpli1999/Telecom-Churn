# Telecom-Churn
Telecom Churn Analytics
Performed churn analysis for a telecom provider to identify customers at risk of leaving the service. Conducted end-to-end data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key churn indicators such as contract type, tenure, payment method, and service usage patterns.

Engineered new features to enhance model performance and address class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE. Built and compared multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Model Performance Summary:

Logistic Regression – Validation Accuracy: 81.80%, Test Accuracy: 79.43%

SVM – Validation Accuracy: 80.76%, Test Accuracy: 79.05%

Decision Tree – Validation Accuracy: 78.67%, Test Accuracy: 76.59%

Visualized key trends and model outputs using matplotlib and seaborn, and interpreted feature importance to provide actionable recommendations. Delivered insights to improve customer retention strategies, such as targeting high-risk segments and optimizing service plans. The project demonstrated the value of predictive analytics in reducing churn and improving business performance.
